          <p id="u12267-5">We participate in clubs, and teachers encourage everyone to participate in the 2024&nbsp; International&nbsp; School Cyberfair.. This year's theme is to show Taiwan's life and vitality. We are in the first grade. Everyone is participating in an online blog competition for the first time. Everything is rusty. After waiting for the task to be completed, we find that we have learned a lot and broadened our horizons. Our school is located near the Zuoying District of Kaohsiung, so after school, we occasionally meet some foreign and foreign tourists. This sparked our interest in doing something for our hometown. Why don't we set up a website to introduce this historic place and let more people come here? Classmates work together, work together, and are determined to do it well.</p>
          <p id="u12267-6">&nbsp;</p>
          <p id="u12267-8">Although the process of making web pages in this period was delayed from the beginning of the school until February 25 after experiencing pneumonia in Wuhan, there was a discussion at the end. The teacher had to discuss the progress of web page production with classmates using mobile LINE video. Make a lot of work for web pages.</p>

Title: Teacher of Data Processing Teaching subjects: web design planning guidance, database Guiding experience:
Through the division of thematic production, students' ability to unite and assist each other, communication and coordination is tested. Students learn to take pictures, collect information, make web pages, make movies, and have the ability to visit. Especially in the visit, students learn how to contact and arrange. Pre&#45;conceived access to topic content, all of which are very rare learning experiences. This year is suitable for Wuhan Pneumonia. Students have postponed the opening of school, so some works are not perfect and they are completed in a hurry. All these are very rare learning experiences. At the same time, through this special topic, let me experience the historical landmarks and places of interest in Kaohsiung City. I hope that through the introduction of the blog, I can attract more people to experience this beautiful city during the holidays. Instructor: Nai&#45;xin Chang
